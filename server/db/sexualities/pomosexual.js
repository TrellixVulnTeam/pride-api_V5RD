    "Pomosexuality is defined as refusing, avoiding, or not fitting any sexual orientation label in terms of conventional labels or classifications, such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or labels on the asexual or aromantic spectrums.[1][2][3] It challenges categorizations in favor of largely unmapped possibility and the intense charge that comes with transgression. Some pomosexual people may be queer or questioning, and others may not be. ",
