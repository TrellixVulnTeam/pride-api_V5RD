    'Lesbian, a term with multiple definitions, is most often defined as a woman who is attracted to other women romantically, sexually, or both. The term is generally used as a self-identification of sexual or romantic orientation. Although lesbians are frequently defined as women who are exclusively attracted to women, another definition is women primarily attracted to other women. Some prefer to use or additionally use "gay" or "gay woman" as an identifier.',
