  description:
    "Sapphic, sometimes known as woman loving woman (WLW), or sapphist, refers to a woman of any sexual orientation who is attracted to other women. Another definition is specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women of all identities who are attracted to other women. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.",
