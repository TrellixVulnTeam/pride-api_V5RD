  description:
    "Hijra is a culture-specific identity found in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. It is a separate identity from man and woman, and also separate from the concept of transgender. In most cases, Hijras are individuals who were assigned male at birth and have a feminine presentation, but may also include individuals who are intersex or assigned female at birth as well. Hijras may or may not undergo surgery to transition. During British rule of India, Hijras were criminalized and discriminated against as part of the Criminal Tribes act of 1871. They were decriminalized in 1952, but stigmatization against Hijras continued for some time afterwards. In 2014, Hijras gained official government recognition as a separate gender in India.",
