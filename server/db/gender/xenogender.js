  description:
    'Xenogender is defined as "a gender that cannot be contained by human understandings of gender; more concerned with crafting other methods of gender categorization and hierarchy such as those relating to animals, plants, or other creatures/things". Xenogender individuals may use ideas and identities outside of the gender binary to describe themselves and avoid binary gendered identifiers, such as using only their first name or the name of an animal. They may feel they cannot place a label on themselves, or feel as though they lack the terms to fully express their gender or identity, something that derives from a lexical gap. The term "xenogender" itself was designed to help fill the lexical gap by using terms not typically associated with gender or describing gender with metaphors. Since it is a gender identity that is outside the binary concepts of masculinity and femininity, xenogender is a non-binary identity."',
