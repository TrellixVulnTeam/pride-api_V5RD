  description:
    "Waria is a label that originates from Indonesia and can be interpreted in many ways; one more prevalent use is to describe men who live as women. Waria has many other meanings, including being a synonym to transfeminine, nonbinary, and other interpretations. It is sometimes compared to western terms, such as 'transgender woman' or 'transvestite'; however, none of those words are completely accurate and in doing so can perpetuate cultural erasure and remove the historical and culturally specific context.",
