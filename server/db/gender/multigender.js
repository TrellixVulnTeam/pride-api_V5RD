  description:
    "Multigender is a gender identity where a person experiences more than one gender. More generally, multigender is used as an umbrella term for any gender identity that involves more than one gender at a time. This includes identities such as bigender, pangender, and can even include fluid identities such as genderfluid and genderflux. A person who is multigender can identify as any number of genders at once, including genders such as agender and neutrois. They can also use whichever pronouns they want, and may or may not physically transition. While people may identify as multigender by itself, it is sometimes explained that doing so is the equivalent of identifying as just trans without any further specifications, such as just identifying as a trans woman or some non-binary gender.",
